# Test Taking and Creating Website

[Demo](https://calebbelrose.epizy.com)

There's a homepage that loads and displays all of the tests.

There's also a test page that that loads test questions and answers from the database when the page is loaded, only displaying them when the user is on that question.

Users can go back to a question they previously answered and can only proceed when they've selected an answer to their current question.

When the user has answered all of the questions, their result is displayed on the test page. They can then choose to take the test again or go back to the homepage to select another test.
